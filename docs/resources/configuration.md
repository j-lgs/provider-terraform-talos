# talos_configuration (Resource)

Represents the basic CA/CRT bundle that's needed to provision a Talos cluster. Contains information that is shared with, and essential for the creation of, worker and controlplane nodes.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `kubernetes_endpoint` (String) The kubernetes endpoint that the nodes and the kubectl client will connect to. Can be a DNS hostname or an IP address and may include a port number. Must begin with "https://".
- `kubernetes_version` (String) The version of kubernetes and all it's components (kube-apiserver, kubelet, kube-scheduler, etc) that will be deployed onto the cluster.
- `name` (String) Configures the cluster's name
- `talos_endpoints` (List of String) A list of that the talosctl client will connect to. Can be a DNS hostname or an IP address and may include a port number. Must begin with "https://".
- `target_version` (String) The version of the Talos cluster configuration that will be generated.

- `encryption` (Attributes) Specifies system disk partition encryption settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--encryption))
### Read-Only

- `base_config` (String, Sensitive) JSON Serialised object that contains information needed to create controlplane and worker node configurations.
- `id` (String) Identifier hash, derived from the cluster's name.
- `talos_config` (String, Sensitive) Talosconfig YAML that can be used by the talosctl client to communicate with the cluster.

### Nested Schema for `encryption`

Optional:

- `ephemeral` (Attributes) Represents partition encryption settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--encryption--ephemeral))
- `state` (Attributes) Represents partition encryption settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--encryption--state))

<a id="nestedatt--encryption--ephemeral"></a>
### Nested Schema for `encryption.ephemeral`

Optional:

- `blocksize` (Number) Defines the encryption block size.
- `cipher` (String) Cipher kind to use for the encryption. Depends on the encryption provider.
- `keys` (Attributes List) Specifies system disk partition encryption settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--encryption--ephemeral--keys))
- `keysize` (Number) Defines the encryption key size.
- `perf_options` (List of String) Additional --perf parameters for LUKS2 encryption.
- `provider` (String) Encryption provider to use for the encryption.

### Nested Schema for `encryption.ephemeral.keys`

Optional:

- `key_static` (String) Represents a throw away key type.
- `node_id` (Boolean) Represents a deterministically generated key from the node UUID and PartitionLabel. Setting this value to true will enable it.
- `slot` (Number) Defines the encryption block size.
